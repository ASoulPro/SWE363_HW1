        <h1>America</h1>
        <p>
          Americas, also called America, the two continents, North and South
          America, of the Western Hemisphere. The climatic zones of the two
          continents are quite different. In North America, subarctic climate
          prevails in the north, gradually warming southward and finally
          becoming tropical near the southern isthmus.

          In South America, the climate in the north is tropical, becoming
          cooler southward, and finally becoming a cold, marine climate at Cape
          Horn.Read More default imageRead More on This TopicWestern
          colonialism: Spain’s American empireOnly gradually did the Spaniards
          realize the possibilities of America. They had completed the
          occupation of the larger West Indian islands…The Americas can be
          roughly divided into two major cultural regions: Latin America, which
          includes North America south of the Rio Grande, the islands of the
          West Indies, and all of South America; and Anglo-America, which
          includes Canada and the United States. The term Middle America is
          sometimes used to designate Mexico, Central America, and the West
          Indies collectively.

          The name America is derived from that of the Italian explorer and
          friend of Christopher Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, who made several
          voyages to the Western Hemisphere and, perhaps more important,
          described his travels there in letters to friends in Italy.

          One of these letters, published in 1504, used the term “Mundus Novus”
          (“New World”) in referring to South America. The letter circulated
          from hand to hand, and a copy reached the German cartographer Martin
          Waldseemüller, who was apparently unaware of Columbus’ voyage of 1498,
          during which he had discovered the continent of South America.
          Waldseemüller included some of Vespucci’s writings in his
          Cosmographiae introductio (1507; Introduction to Cosmography) and
          observed that “another fourth part [of the inhabited earth] had been
          discovered by Americus Vespucius,” and he suggested that the new land
          be called America, in recognition of that explorer’s voyages.
          Waldseemüller’s book was widely read, and the new appellation was
          eventually universally accepted.
