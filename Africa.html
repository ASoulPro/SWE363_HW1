        <h1>Africa</h1>
        <p>
          Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous
          continent, after Asia. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square
          miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total
          surface area and 20% of its land area.[4] With 1.3 billion
          people[1][2] as of 2018, it accounts for about 16% of the world's
          human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea
          to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast,
          the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.
          The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It
          contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states (countries), four
          territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no
          recognition. The majority of the continent and its countries are in
          the Northern Hemisphere, with a substantial portion and number of
          countries in the Southern Hemisphere.
        </p>

          Africa's average population is the youngest amongst all the
          continents;[5][6] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide
          median age was 30.4.[7] Algeria is Africa's largest country by area,
          and Nigeria is its largest by population. Africa, particularly central
          Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans
          and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of
          the earliest hominids and their ancestors as well as later ones that
          have been dated to around 7 million years ago, including
          Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis,
          Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster—the earliest Homo sapiens
          (modern human), found in Ethiopia, date to circa 200,000 years ago.[8]
          Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas;
          it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to
          southern temperate zones.[9]

          Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages.
          In the late 19th century, European countries colonised almost all of
          Africa; most present states in Africa emerged from a process of
          decolonisation in the 20th century. African nations cooperate through
          the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in
          Addis Ababa.

          Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of then-known
          northern Africa to the west of the Nile river, and in its widest sense
          referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient
          Libya).[10][11] This name seems to have originally referred to a
          native Libyan tribe, an ancestor of modern Berbers; see Terence for
          discussion. The name had usually been connected with the Phoenician
          word ʿafar meaning "dust",[12] but a 1981 hypothesis[13] has asserted
          that it stems from the Berber word ifri (plural ifran) meaning "cave",
          in reference to cave dwellers.[14] The same word[14] may be found in
          the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber
          tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern
          Libya.[15]
