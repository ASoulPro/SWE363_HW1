        <h1>Europe</h1>
        <p>
          Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and
          mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost part of
          Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic
          Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the
          east. The eastern border uniquely comprises a long and mixed line of
          mountain ranges, rivers, seas, and straits that would normally define
          a subcontinent. However, Europe retains its status as a full continent
          because of its great physical size and the weight of history and
          tradition. It is the 6th largest continent in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the
          watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River,
          the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish
          Straits.[9] The term "continent" usually implies the physical
          geography of a large land mass completely or almost completely
          surrounded by water at its borders. However the Europe-Asia part of
          the border is somewhat arbitrary and inconsistent with this definition
          because of its partial adherence to the Ural and Caucasus Mountains
          rather than a series of partly joined waterways suggested by
          cartographer Herman Moll in 1715. This water divide runs from the
          Turkish straits to the upper part of the Ob River where it drains into
          the Arctic Ocean. Prior to the adoption of the current convention, the
          border between Europe and Asia had been redefined several times since
          its first conception in classical antiquity as a series of rivers,
          seas, and straits that were believed to extend an unknown distance
          east and north from the Mediterranean Sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current division of Eurasia into two continents now reflects
          East-West cultural, linguistic and ethnic differences which vary on a
          spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The geographic border
          between Europe and Asia does not follow any state boundaries and now
          only follows a few bodies of water. Turkey is generally considered a
          transcontinental country divided entirely by water, while Russia and
          Kazakhstan are only partly divided by waterways. France, Portugal, the
          Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom are also transcontinental
          (or more properly, intercontinental, when oceans or large seas are
          involved) in that their main land areas are in Europe while pockets of
          their territories are located in other continents separated from
          Europe by large bodies of water. Spain, for example, has territories
          south of the Mediterranean Sea namely Ceuta and Melilla which are
          parts of Africa and share a border with Morocco. According to the
          current convention, Georgia and Azerbaijan are transcontinental
          countries where waterways have been completely replaced by mountains
          as the divide between continents.

          Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000 sq mi), or
          2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area). Politically, Europe is
          divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the
          largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and
          comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of
          about 741 million (about 11% of the world population) as of
          2018.[2][3] The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic
          currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent,
          even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is
          severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable
          than close to the coast.
